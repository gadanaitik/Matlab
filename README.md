# Matlab

The Matlab repository is a collection of different functions and operations in Matlab. Matlab is a powerful, high-level language that is extremely helpful in mathematical modeling. Topics like _ Linear Algebra, ODEs, PDEs, Regression Analysis, Machine Learning, AI, etc. If programmed correctly, most of the coding can be done very efficiently and Matlab allows you to translate your code into other languages like C/C++, Python, etc. 
Here, I have various functions and operations that anyone can access and scale-up to their liking.
